## Decisions Detail

### next-frontend-config-base/TD-01

**Recommendation:** Three converging reasons: (1) **Type-inference matches the FE's strict-TS culture** — `lib/env.ts` exports a typed `env` object with no `as` casts, satisfying the project's "Type Safety" working principle. (2) **Ecosystem gravity in Next.js / React 19** — Zod is the de-facto schema language for App Router (Server Actions inputs, form resolvers, future contract validation), so introducing it once at the env layer compounds value for forms in Phase 02+. (3) **Direct enablement of TD-02 Option A (`@t3-oss/env-nextjs`)** — t3-env's first-citizen validator. Backend parity with Joi is not load-bearing: env schemas are not shared FE↔BE (different runtimes, different key sets); two validators across two subprojects is a bounded cost.
**Libraries:** zod

### next-frontend-config-base/TD-02

**Recommendation:** The only option that combines (i) **type-level NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix enforcement**, (ii) **runtime Proxy-based leak detection**, and (iii) **single-file, single-import-path consumer ergonomics**. Option B reaches roughly the same _structural_ outcome at higher implementation and maintenance cost, with a weaker guarantee (no prefix enforcement, no proxy). Option C is unsafe at any non-trivial team size. The marginal cost over B is one ~3KB dep — well-spent for the strongest boundary among the three.
**Libraries:** @t3-oss/env-nextjs

### next-frontend-config-base/TD-03

**Recommendation:** Aligned with the BFF testing strategy and architectural commitment already documented in `next-frontend/CLAUDE.md` (Route Handlers as the only NestJS caller; BFF tests stub `fetch` via MSW). Eliminates CORS, eliminates public exposure of the backend URL, and produces the smallest correct foundation. Option B's `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is a future-proofing concession with no current consumer — and adding a public key later is a non-breaking change, while removing one is breaking. Option C ties a foundational decision to infra work explicitly deferred elsewhere. The Docker networking gap (how server-in-container resolves the backend) is a separate orthogonal decision, surfaced below.

## Inherited Decisions Detail

### phase-02-auth/TD-01

**Recommendation:** Argon2id — For a greenfield project in 2026, Argon2id is the OWASP-recommended choice. The native build dependency is a one-time Docker setup cost. The project has no legacy constraints favoring bcrypt. OWASP minimum: 19MiB memory, 2 iterations.

**Libraries:** `argon2@^0.41.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-02

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs/passport) — The project plan includes only email/password auth for now, but the plugin architecture costs little and future phases may add social login. Aligns with official NestJS docs, making onboarding and maintenance easier.

**Note:** Decision deliberately diverged from the Recommendation during implementation — custom guards were preferred over `@nestjs/passport` to keep the dependency surface smaller; social login is not on the near-term roadmap, so the plugin-architecture benefit did not justify the extra abstraction layer.

**Libraries:** `@nestjs/jwt@^11.0.0`

### phase-02-auth/TD-03

**Recommendation:** Option A (Refresh Token Rotation) — Provides the strongest security model with automatic theft detection. The DB write overhead is acceptable for a video platform (auth refresh is infrequent vs. video operations). PostgreSQL is already in the stack, so no new infrastructure needed. Race conditions can be mitigated with a short grace period for the old token.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth/TD-04

**Recommendation:** Option B (Random Opaque Tokens in DB) — Revocability is important: when a user requests a new password reset, previous tokens should be invalidated. The DB table is trivial to implement, and the tokens table can also serve future needs (e.g., API keys). Keeps email tokens decoupled from the JWT auth system.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth/TD-05

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs-modules/mailer) — Best NestJS integration with minimal boilerplate. Supports SMTP (matching the architecture diagram), works with MailHog/Mailpit for local development without external dependencies, and scales to any SMTP provider in production. Template engine support (Handlebars) simplifies email formatting. No vendor lock-in.

**Libraries:** `@nestjs-modules/mailer@^2.x`, `handlebars@^4.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-06

**Recommendation:** Option A (class-validator + class-transformer) — This is a backend-only project (no shared schemas with frontend), so Zod's single-source-of-truth advantage is less impactful. class-validator is the documented NestJS approach, and the project already uses decorators extensively (TypeORM entities, NestJS DI). Fewer integration surprises with NestJS 11.

**Libraries:** `class-validator@^0.14.x`, `class-transformer@^0.5.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-07

**Recommendation:** Option A (Custom Domain Exception Filter) — Provides machine-readable error codes that the Next.js frontend can switch on, without the overhead of RFC 9457's URI-based type system. The project is single-consumer (first-party frontend), so a simple `{ statusCode, error, message }` format with domain codes balances clarity and simplicity. The custom filter cost is low — two small files.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth/TD-08

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs/throttler) — Native NestJS integration is decisive: the guard system allows scoping rate limiting to `AuthModule` only via module-level `APP_GUARD`, with `@SkipThrottle()` for exemptions. The project is single-instance with no distributed requirements, so in-memory storage is sufficient. Using express-rate-limit would bypass NestJS's DI and guard lifecycle for no clear benefit.

**Libraries:** `@nestjs/throttler@^6.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-09

**Recommendation:** Option B (Opaque) — Since DB lookup is mandatory (TD-03), JWT signature adds no security value. Opaque tokens are shorter, leak no data, and are simpler to generate.

**Note:** Decision deliberately diverged from the Recommendation — JWT was kept to reuse the access-token signing/verification infrastructure (`@nestjs/jwt`), trading token size and base64-readability for a single token format across the codebase.

**Libraries:** `@nestjs/jwt@^11.0.0`

### phase-02-auth/TD-10

**Recommendation:** Option A — The platform is a video sharing service with URL-based channel handles. A strict `[a-z0-9_]` allowlist is the simplest and most portable choice: no extra dependencies, no edge cases around hyphen positioning, and the `user_<random>` fallback provides a valid handle even for extreme email prefixes. Hyphens can always be added in a future iteration if user feedback justifies it.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-01

**Recommendation:** Official, core-team-maintained, guaranteed NestJS 11 compatibility. The `registerAs()` factory pattern solves the TypeORM CLI sharing problem: the factory function can be imported as a plain function by `data-source.ts` while also serving as a DI injection token inside NestJS. Building a custom module recreates solved functionality; third-party packages carry maintenance risk.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-02

**Recommendation:** First-class integration with `@nestjs/config` via `validationSchema`, requiring zero custom wiring. Handles string-to-number coercion natively. Using a different tool for env validation vs. request validation is reasonable — env config is validated once at startup, DTOs are validated per-request. Zod is elegant but adds a third validation paradigm to the project.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-03

**Recommendation:** The project roadmap explicitly calls for auth, email, and storage in upcoming phases. Namespaced configs provide clear file boundaries per domain, typed injection via `ConfigType<typeof databaseConfig>`, and natural scalability. The `registerAs()` factory is dual-purpose: DI token inside NestJS and plain importable function for `data-source.ts`.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-04

**Recommendation:** Natural outcome of choosing `@nestjs/config` with `registerAs`. The factory is already callable by design. `data-source.ts` imports it, calls `dotenv.config()`, then calls the factory. Zero duplication, minimal code, no extra abstraction.

**Libraries:** —

## Inherited Conventions

- Backend config uses `@nestjs/config` with namespaced `registerAs(name, () => ({...}))` factories — one file per domain in `src/config/`. _(from phase 01)_
- Env variables are validated by a Joi schema in `src/config/env.validation.ts`, passed to `ConfigModule.forRoot({ validationSchema, validationOptions: { allowUnknown: true, abortEarly: false } })`. _(from phase 01)_
- Config is injected into modules via `ConfigType<typeof xxxConfig>` and `@Inject(xxxConfig.KEY)`; the same factory is importable as a plain function for non-DI contexts (e.g., TypeORM CLI). _(from phase 01)_
- `data-source.ts` loads `.env` via `import 'dotenv/config'` at the top, then imports `databaseConfig` and calls it as a plain function. _(from phase 01)_
- Database connection parameters (host, port, etc.) are sourced from a single `databaseConfig` factory — never duplicated between `AppModule` and `data-source.ts`. _(from phase 01)_
- `TypeOrmModule.forRootAsync` is used (not `forRoot`), with `imports: [ConfigModule]`, `inject: [databaseConfig.KEY]`, `useFactory` returning options including `autoLoadEntities: true`, `synchronize: false`. _(from phase 01)_

## Inherited Deferred Capabilities

| Capability | Status | Origin phase | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Telas de cadastro, login, confirmação de conta e recuperação de senha | deferred | phase-02-auth | `next-frontend/` is not initialized in this phase; UI surfaces start in a later phase. |

## UI Inventory

_Frontend-runtime only — no screen inventory needed for this phase.
Run /screen-inventory <arg> if a UI surface is added in a future revision._

## Non-UI / Deferred Capabilities

_None._

| Route handlers (`app/api/**/route.ts`) | Vitest unit (`*.test.ts`) for branching logic AND/OR `*.integration.test.ts` with MSW intercepting `fetch` to NestJS API |
| Route handlers — simple proxy | `*.integration.test.ts` with MSW only |
| Server actions | `*.integration.test.ts` with MSW; E2E for the submit flow |
| Middleware / error / loading / not-found / metadata | See `artifacts/future-types.md` — depends on type |
